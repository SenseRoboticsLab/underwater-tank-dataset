<h1 style="text-align: center;">Tank Dataset: An Underwater Multi-Sensor Dataset for SLAM Evaluation</h1>

![Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tank_overview.png)

The Tank dataset offers sequences of varying difficulty, representing diverse underwater conditions. The eight sequences were collected in a water tank, covering different areas including a textureless wall ((1) and (3) in the figure), a wave generator ((2) in the figure), a beach ((4) in the figure), and an underwater structure covered with AprilTag markers ((5), (b), and (c) in the figure). Additionally, a fiducial-marker-based SLAM system is employed to provide high-accuracy 6-DoF pose ground truth data, enabling rigorous evaluation and comparison of underwater SLAM algorithms.
